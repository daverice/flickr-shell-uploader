== SUMMARY ==

This is an extremely simple and naive photo uploader for Flickr.

== REQUIREMENTS ==
 * curl
 * awk
 * grep
 * tr
 * md5sum

== USAGE ==
./flickr-shell-uploader <file> [<file> ...]

It will create a "frob" which will need to be authenticated against your
account. When it asks you to, please visit the URL it prints out which will
take you to a page on Flickr where you can authenticate the request.

Once authenticated, a token is granted to this script that will be used from
then on to upload to your account. The frob and token are stored in
~/.flickr-shell-uploader. If you have removed access for this application
you should delete this file and start the authentication process again.

== NOTES ==
Proxies should be handled by curl natively.

== CHANGELOG ==
0.0.1 - extremely naive, handles some errors.
